## Description

Arrow is a fun, experimental interpreted programming language that uses arrows and special syntax elements to make programming visually intuitive and compact. Developed using JavaScript in the `Deno 2` ecosystem, Arrow is intended for programmers who enjoy minimalist and symbolic syntax, allowing for efficient expressions and type-checked assignments. This language is especially suited for developers interested in learning about language design, parsing, and interpreter construction.

## Purpose
Arrow aims to create an intuitive programming experience focused on simplicity and a unique syntax that is both visually distinct and easy to read. With features like variable type-checking, flexible function definitions, and arrow-based operators, Arrow provides an alternative way to experiment with programming fundamentals, control structures, and I/O. Itâ€™s designed as a sandbox for learning and expanding language development skills in a modular, extensible way.

> [!NOTE]  
> Most features here will eventualy be added, features are not listed by order, list can change over time.

# Setup

To get started with the Arrow language, follow these steps:

## 1. Install Deno 2

First, you need to install Deno 2. You can download and install it from the [official Deno website](https://deno.com/).

## 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OMouta/arrow.git
cd arrow-lang
```

## 3. Run the Scripts

You can use the scripts defined in the `deno.jsonc` file to run and test the Arrow language.

### Run the Arrow Interpreter

To run the Arrow interpreter, use the following command:

```sh
deno task arrow path/to/your/code.arrow
```

### Run the Tests

To run the tests with debug information, use the following command:

```sh
deno task test
```

This will execute the Arrow code in the `test/default.arrow` file and output debug information.

# Syntax Reference

## 1. Assignment

### Basic Assignment:
```arrow
<type> variableName <- value
```

Examples:
```arrow
<str> message <- "Hello Arrow"
```

## 2. Function Definition and Invocation

### Function Definition:
```arrow
<bool fn> functionName(<const int> arg1, <const float> arg2 ) {
    // function body
    -> returnValue
}
```

- `<bool fn>`: Denotes the start of a function and its return type.
- `->`: Return keyword, followed by value.

### Function Invocation:
```arrow
functionName(arg1, arg2, ...)
```

Examples:
```arrow
<str fn> greetUser(<const str> name) {
    -> "Hello, " + name
}

message <- greetUser("ArrowUser")
```

## 3. Operators and Expressions

### Arithmetic Operators:

- Addition: `x + y`
- Subtraction: `x - y`
- Multiplication: `x * y`
- Division: `x / y`

### Logical Operators:

- And: `x && y`
- Or: `x || y`
- Not: `!! x`

### Comparison Operators:

- Equal to: `x == y`
- Not equal to: `x != y`
- Greater than: `x > y`
- Less than: `x < y`
- Greater than or equal to: `x >= y`
- Less than or equal to: `x <= y`

Examples:
```arrow
<var> result <- x + y
<var> isActive <- flag && condition
<var> isEqual <- x == y
<var> isNotEqual <- x != y
<var> isGreater <- x > y
<var> isLesser <- x < y
<var> isGreaterOrEqual <- x >= y
<var> isLesserOrEqual <- x <= y
```

## 4. Control Flow Statements

### If-Else Conditionals:

```arrow
if -> condition {
    // if block
} elif -> condition {
    // else block
} else {
    // else block
}
```

### While Loop:

```arrow
while -> condition {
    // loop body
}
```

### For Loop:

```arrow
for -> init ; condition ; increment {
    // loop body
}
```

Examples:

```arrow
if -> score >= 50 {
    result <- "Pass"
} else {
    result <- "Fail"
}

i <== 0
while -> i < 5 {
    i <- i + 1
}
```

## 5. Arrays and Objects

### Array Declaration:

```arrow
<any> arrayName <- [item1, item2, ...]
```

### Access Array Elements:

```arrow
<any> item <- arrayName[index]
```

### Object Declaration:

```arrow
<obj> objectName <- { key1: value1, key2: value2, ... }
```

### Access Object Properties:

```arrow
<any> propertyValue <- objectName.key
```

Examples:
```arrow
<int> items <== [10, 20, 30]
<int> firstItem <== items[0]

<obj> settings <== { volume: 75, theme: "dark" }
<str> currentTheme <== settings.theme
```

## 6. Built-In Functions

### Print (Output to console):

```arrow
print(message)
```

### Input (User input):

```arrow
<str> inputValue <- input("Prompt message")
```

- `print`: Outputs the provided message to the console or display.
- `input`: Displays a prompt and waits for user input.

Examples:

```arrow
print("Hello, Arrow!")
<str> userName <- input("Enter your name: ")
```

## 7. Comments

### Single-Line Comment:

```arrow
:: This is a comment
```

### Multi-Line Comment:

```arrow
::> This
is
a
comment <::
```

## 8. Full Example Code

```arrow
:: Declare variables
<const int> age <- 25
<const str> name <- "ArrowLang"

:: Function definition with return type
<bool fn> isValidAge(<const int> userAge) {
    if -> userAge >= 18 {
        -> true
    } else {
        -> false
    }
}

:: Function call
<const bool> canVote <- isValidAge(age)

:: Using a loop with an array
<const int> values <- [10, 20, 30]
<var int> sum <- 0

for -> i <- 0 ; i < values.length ; i <- i + 1 {
    sum <- sum + values[i]
}

:: Output the sum
print("Total Sum: " + sum)
```
